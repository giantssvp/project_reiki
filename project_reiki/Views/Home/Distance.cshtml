        <b>Distance Healing:</b><br />
        <br />
        This modality is the least experienced purely because it is “DISTANCE” and it is “HEALING”.
        Most of us are not aware of how an healing happens, leave alone how can it work through
        distance, followed by questions raised by our rational mind like what happens during the
        session? How will it work? How will I know it works? Is this all true?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="justify">
        <b>What is Distance Healing?</b><br /> <br />
        To best answer this by example, Have you ever in your life thought of someone, something, it
        could be anything a phone call from a loved one, thinking about a friend and they call or meet
        you by “coincidence”, sometimes when you look at some things you “know” it will work or “it wont
        work” without knowing how you know it. Have you ever heard of “telepathy” and understand how
        it works -
        Then this is a proof that energies connect in distance, you thinking
        about someone or something and they reciprocating at the same time is nothing but strong
        energetic connection towards the person or event that they just come across as coincidence.


        Likewise, Universal energy has no boundaries, like the light, sun, moon air, sky, flowing water
        has no boundaries, similarly, Distance Healing has no boundaries. It is mere tapping those
        universal vibrations and passing them through to someone who needs it the most at a given
        point in a time.

        <b>What happens in a session:</b><br /><br />
        A practitioner is a channel to draw the energy from the Universe to an individual mind, body and
        spirit, the energy is so subtle , yet powerful that changes reflect almost immediately after a
        session. Individual / client is expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so they can feel
        a connection to the energy and experience for themselves how the energy flows. It is best if the
        client is aware of things prior the session to better gauge the changes the energy brings in their
        life.

    <br />
    <p align="justify">

        <b>Will the practitioner know what is happening in my life? </b><br /><br />
        The answer is NO, Practitioners are individuals who are attuned in healing and in healing the
        practitioner is a medium to channelise the energy into areas of life where healing is required the
        most. The energy are so subtle are strong and more towards client needs that the clients may
        get impressions and feeling about the areas they need to work up or move on instead of the
        practitioner.


    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="justify">

        <b>How will I know the practitioner is true and is committed for the session?</b><br /> <br />
        No practitioner will risk the energy flow within themselves for money, as nothing is hidden from
        the Universe. So rest assured if a practitioner has committed time for a session the healing
        begins at that time.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">

        All sessions are confidential that even the practitioner does not need to know the current state
        of mind of an individual, all they need to know is the client's willingness to experience the energy
        and readiness to change their life situations, it is for the client to know the difference and get the
        result.
