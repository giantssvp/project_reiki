        <b>Distance Healing:</b><br />
        </br>
        This modality is the least experienced purely because it is “DISTANCE” and it is “ HEALING” .
        Most of us are not aware of how an healing works, leave alone how can it work through
        distance, followed by questions raised by our rational mind like what happens in healing? How
        will it work? How will I know it works? Is this all true?
</p>
</br>
<p>
    <b>What is Distance Healing?</b><br /> <br />
    To best answer this by example, Have you ever in your life thought of someone, something, it
    could be anything a phone call from a loved one, thinking about a friend and they call or meet
    you by “coincidence”, sometimes when you look at somethings you “know” it will work or “it wont
    work” without knowing how you know it. Have you ever heard of “telepathy” and understand how
    it works -
    Then this is a proof that energies connect in distance, you thinking
    about someone or something and they reciprocating at the same time is nothing but strong
    energetic connection towards the person or event that they just come across as coincidence.

</p>
<p>
    Likewise, Universal energy has no boundaries, like the light, sun, moon air, sky, flowing water
    has no boundaries Distance Healing has no boundaries. It is mere tapping those universal
    vibrations and passing them through to someone who needs it the most at a given point in a
    time.
</p>
<br />
<p>

    <b>What happens in a session:</b><br /><br />
    A practioner is a channel to draw the energy from the Universe to an individual mind, body and
    spirit, the energy is so subtle , yet powerful that changes reflect almost immediately after a
    session.
    Individual / client is expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so they can feel a
    connection to the energy and experience for themselves how the energy flows. It is best if the
    client is aware of things prior the session to better gauge the changes the energy brings in their
    life.

    You are expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so you can feel a connection to the
    energy and experience how the energy flows. It is best if you are aware of things prior the
    session to better gauge the changes the energy brings in your life.
</p>

<br />
<p>

    <b>Will the practioner know what is happening in my life? </b><br /><br />

    The answer is NO, Practioners are indivisuals who are attuned in healing and in healing the
    practioner is a medium to channelise the energy into areas of life where healing is required the
    most The energy are so subtle are strong and more towards client needs that the clients may
    get impressions and feeling about the areas they need to work up or move on instead of the
    practioner.
</p>
<br />
<p>

    <b>How will I know the practionier is true and is commited for the session?</b><br /> <br />
    No practionier will risk the energy flow within themselves for money, as nothing is hidden from
    the Universe. So rest assured if a practioner has committed time for a session the healing
    begins at that time.
</p>
<p>

    All sessions are confidentatl that even the practioner doesnt need to know the current state of
    mind of an individual, all they need to know is the client willingess to experience the enegy and
    readiness to change thier life situtations, it is for the client to know the difference and get the
    result.

    <br/><b>What is Reiki?</b><br/>
</p>
<p>
    Reiki is a Universal life force energy which can be used to provide emotional and physical healing to the recipient either through hands on / hands off sessions. It is natural, non invasive healing therapy that works wonders at all most all levels. Although the main purpose of a Reiki Session is to bring about deep relaxation, It is also very effective in reducing pain ( both  emotional and physical), helps one in identifying  their “blocks” which prevents them to step up and helps in releasing those blocks thus giving a sense of “freedom” at all levels.
</p>
<p>
    Things to know prior to the Session:
    A Reiki Practitioner is attuned by a Master and so is deemed qualified to act as a medium to receive and share the Universal Life force Energy.
    In most cases Practitioner might use hands off technique - which means the client will not be touched or asked to remove any clothing during the sessions.
    If a Practitioner needs to use Hands on technique then the client is informed and permission is taken before starting the session.
    There are no minimum or maximum time to allocate for a session, however  a minimum of 45 minutes is recommended to fully experience this Energy.
</p>
<p>
A Reiki Practitioner is someone who is attuned to receive those Universal Energy and acts as a Medium to bridge the gap between the recipient and the Universe.

<b>Crystal Healing?</b><br />
<p></p>
Natural Crystals have innate ability to bring about a  balance and heal one self. when We say “Heal oneself” it is not a Miraculous healing we are talking about, it a systematic way of utilising those healing crystal to align with the main chakras and tap those healing abilities into the physical. It is an amazing blend of utilising the crystal to bring about optimum well being.
<p></p>
<br /> <b>Things to know prior to the Session:</b><br />
<p></p>
A crystal healing practitioner would go through a series of exercise  with the client to understand the areas that needs to be addressed and work with the client to bring about optimal well  being.
Sessions could either be independent or can be clubbed with Reiki to make it more effective.
Crystal healing works better in multiple sessions depending on the client requirement, however a single session can be effective for someone who wants to “get rid of the stress” instantly.

<br /><b>Pellowah Healing?</b><br />
<p></p>
  Pellowah is an Angelic word for “radical shift in consciousness”. This form of healing connects all 12 strands of DNA ready for activation. It also unblocks and realigns all meridians within the body giving a feeling of connection and well being. As the name suggests, it also results in radical shift in consciousness.
<p></p>
Pellowah provides a feeling of well being that seems to last and in fact it will get stronger as time goes by. This is because the healing happens from inside out.
<p></p>
<br /><b>Things to know prior to the Session:</b><br />
<p></p>
This healing is an Individual experience,the Practitioner  is a vessel for the transference of the energy to facilitate the healing and therefore has no personal input into the healing or the experience that you as client will have.
The healing will continue for 24 hours from the commencement of the session, after that time you will benefit from the ongoing effects of the healing.
 Each of the Pellowah healing sessions are independent of other, a Practitioner remains silent for the entire time during the session and it is totally an hands off healing technique.
Sessions will be conducted in a silent room with no music, and each session would last for 45-60 minutes.
<p></p>
