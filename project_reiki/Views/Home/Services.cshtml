        <b>Distance Healing:</b><br />
        <br />
        This modality is the least experienced purely because it is “DISTANCE” and it is “HEALING”.
        Most of us are not aware of how an healing happens, leave alone how can it work through
        distance, followed by questions raised by our rational mind like what happens during the
        session? How will it work? How will I know it works? Is this all true?
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p align="justify">
        <b>What is Distance Healing?</b><br /> <br />
        To best answer this by example, Have you ever in your life thought of someone, something, it
        could be anything a phone call from a loved one, thinking about a friend and they call or meet
        you by “coincidence”, sometimes when you look at some things you “know” it will work or “it wont
        work” without knowing how you know it. Have you ever heard of “telepathy” and understand how
        it works -
        Then this is a proof that energies connect in distance, you thinking
        about someone or something and they reciprocating at the same time is nothing but strong
        energetic connection towards the person or event that they just come across as coincidence.


        Likewise, Universal energy has no boundaries, like the light, sun, moon air, sky, flowing water
        has no boundaries, similarly, Distance Healing has no boundaries. It is mere tapping those
        universal vibrations and passing them through to someone who needs it the most at a given
        point in a time.

        <b>What happens in a session:</b><br /><br />
        A practitioner is a channel to draw the energy from the Universe to an individual mind, body and
        spirit, the energy is so subtle , yet powerful that changes reflect almost immediately after a
        session. Individual / client is expected to dedicate the committed time to healing so they can feel
        a connection to the energy and experience for themselves how the energy flows. It is best if the
        client is aware of things prior the session to better gauge the changes the energy brings in their
        life.
        
    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="justify">

        <b>Will the practitioner know what is happening in my life? </b><br /><br />
        The answer is NO, Practitioners are individuals who are attuned in healing and in healing the
        practitioner is a medium to channelise the energy into areas of life where healing is required the
        most. The energy are so subtle are strong and more towards client needs that the clients may
        get impressions and feeling about the areas they need to work up or move on instead of the
        practitioner.


    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="justify">

    <b>How will I know the practitioner is true and is committed for the session?</b><br /> <br />
        No practitioner will risk the energy flow within themselves for money, as nothing is hidden from
        the Universe. So rest assured if a practitioner has committed time for a session the healing
        begins at that time.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">

        All sessions are confidential that even the practitioner does not need to know the current state
        of mind of an individual, all they need to know is the client's willingness to experience the energy
        and readiness to change their life situations, it is for the client to know the difference and get the
        result.

        <br /><b>What is Reiki?</b><br /><br/>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Reiki is a Universal life force energy which can be used to provide emotional and physical
        healing to the recipient either through hands on / hands off sessions. It is natural, non invasive
        healing therapy that works wonders at all most all levels. Although the main purpose of a Reiki
        Session is to bring about deep relaxation, It is also very effective in reducing pain ( both
        emotional and physical), helps one in identifying their “blocks” which prevents them to step up
        and helps in releasing those blocks thus giving a sense of “freedom” at all levels.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        <br/><b> Things to know prior to the Session:</b> <br/><br/>
        A Reiki Practitioner is attuned by a Master and so is deemed qualified to act as a medium to
        receive and share the Universal Life force Energy. In most cases practitioner might use hands
        off technique - which means the client will not be touched or asked to remove any clothing
        during the sessions. If a practitioner needs to use hands on technique then the client is
        informed and permission is taken before starting the session. There is no minimum or
        maximum time to allocate for a session, however a 45 minute session is recommended to fully
        experience this Energy.

        A Reiki practitioner is a medium to bridge the gap between the recipient and the Universal life
        force energy.

    <b>Crystal Healing?</b><br /><br/>
    <p align="justify">
    Natural Crystals have innate ability to bring about a balance and heal one self. When we say
    “Heal oneself” it is not a miraculous healing we are talking about, it is a systematic way of utilising
    those healing crystal to align with the main chakras and tap those healing abilities into the
    physical. It is an amazing blend of utilising the crystal to bring about optimum well being.

    </p>
    <br /> <b>Things to know prior to the Session:</b><br /><br/>
    <p align="justify">
    A crystal healing practitioner would go through a series of exercise with the client to understand
    the areas that needs to be addressed and work with the client to bring about optimal well being.
    Sessions could either be independent or can be clubbed with Reiki to make it more effective.
    Crystal healing works better in multiple sessions depending on the client requirement, however
    a single session can be effective for someone who wants to “get rid of the stress” instantly.

    <br /><b>Pellowah Healing?</b><br /> <br/>
    </p><p align="justify">
    Pellowah is an Angelic word for “radical shift in consciousness”. This form of healing connects
    all 12 strands of DNA ready for activation. It also unblocks and realigns all meridians within the
    body giving a feeling of connection and well being. 
    </p><p align="justify">
    Pellowah provides a feeling of well being that seems to last and in fact it will get stronger as
    time goes by. This is because the healing happens from inside out.
    </p><p>
    <br /><b>Things to know prior to the Session:</b><br/><br/>
    </p><p align="justify">
    This healing is an Individual experience,the practitioner is a vessel for the transference of the
    energy to facilitate the healing and therefore has no personal input into the healing or the
    experience that you as client will have. The healing will continue for 24 hours from the
    commencement of the session, after that time you will benefit from the ongoing effects of the
    healing. Each of the Pellowah healing sessions are independent of other, a practitioner remains
    silent for the entire time during the session and it is totally an hands off healing technique.
    Sessions will be conducted in a silent room with no music, and each session would last for
    45-60 minutes.
